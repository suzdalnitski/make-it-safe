# Description
A zero-dependency JavaScript library for error handling. It is inspired by Go, and returns a tuple containing the error and the result instead of throwing an exception.

Unlike other JavaScript libraries ([await-to-js](https://github.com/scopsy/await-to-js)), supports both promises and regular functions.

# Why is this even needed?
Good question!
